## Overview

Octos bridges communication between business branches, specifically designed for printing press companies like Company A, with over 10 branches spread across a city. The system ensures that customer orders and workload information are shared across branches to manage resources efficiently. Octos centralizes data through POS integration, enables staff account management, and automatically balances the workload across branches.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Octos is to minimize operational delays, ensure workload balance, and foster real-time communication among branches. The system accomplishes this by:
1. Automatically transferring large orders to branches with advanced equipment.
2. Allowing each branch to view and manage orders system-wide.
3. Creating worker accounts, where employees log in at the start of each workday to receive assignments, track orders, and coordinate with other branches.

## Core Features

### 1. Branch Communication & POS Data Synchronization
   - **POS Integration**: Data from POS terminals at each branch is centralized, making every branch aware of ongoing orders.
   - **Order Status Tracking**: Branches can track real-time status updates on orders.

### 2. User Accounts for Employees
   - **Employee Accounts**: Each employee has a unique account to track their workday, beginning with a login to start assignments.
   - **Daily Logins**: Employees log in every morning, which registers them as active and ready to receive tasks for the day.

### 3. Workload Management
   - **Workload Caps**: Each branch has a specific workload limit based on its capabilities.
   - **Order Transfers**: Orders exceeding branch limits are automatically transferred to the main branch with advanced equipment.
   - **Customer Wait Time Notifications**: When an order is transferred, a wait time is generated and communicated back to the initiating branch so the customer can be informed.

### 4. Reporting and Notifications
   - **Order Summary**: View daily summaries of completed, pending, and transferred orders.
   - **Notifications**: Branches receive real-time notifications for transferred orders and estimated completion times.

## System Requirements

- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **Docker** (recommended for containerized setup)
- **PostgreSQL** (or any preferred SQL database)
- **Redis** (for caching and real-time notifications)
- **Node.js and npm** (for frontend management)

### Recommended Libraries and Tools

- **Django** for backend management.
- **Django REST framework** for API handling.
- **Celery** with Redis for handling asynchronous tasks like notifications.
- **React.js or Vue.js** for the frontend framework.
- **Twilio or similar SMS API** for sending notifications.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/octos.git
cd octos
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_database_url
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
```

### 5. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Start the Application
For local testing:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

### Branch Communication
Octos enables branches to view customer orders and updates as they happen. Each branch terminal is synchronized through the POS, ensuring all locations have the same data.

### User Management
Each branch creates user accounts for new employees. Workers log in daily, marking them active and enabling them to receive tasks.

### Workload Distribution
When a branch reaches its workload cap, Octos automatically redirects large or complex orders to the main branch and calculates an estimated wait time for the branch and customer.

### Notifications
- **SMS Notifications**: Customers receive SMS updates when there is a change in order status.
- **Branch Notifications**: Branches are alerted when an order is transferred or there is a status change.

## API Documentation

The Octos API allows branch terminals, POS systems, and any future mobile apps to interact with the core system. Key endpoints include:

- `POST /api/auth/login/`: Authenticate an employee login.
- `POST /api/order/transfer/`: Manually transfer an order to the main branch.
- `GET /api/orders/:branch_id`: Retrieve order data for a specific branch.

> Note: A full API documentation will be available in the [API Documentation](https://github.com/yourusername/octos/wiki/API-Documentation) page.
